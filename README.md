# jett-magna-badminton-alert

A lightweight Chrome/Firefox extension that polls your PerfectMind class page every minute. As soon as the “Full” indicator disappears (i.e. any spot opens), it plays a ding and fires a desktop notification so you can jump in and register before it fills up again.

Features

    Zero-configuration: just load the unpacked extension and open your class page

    Works on any PerfectMind class-detail URL (no hard-coded lists)

    Built-in “ring.mp3” alert + desktop notification

    Compatible with Chrome MV3 and Firefox Temporary Add-On
